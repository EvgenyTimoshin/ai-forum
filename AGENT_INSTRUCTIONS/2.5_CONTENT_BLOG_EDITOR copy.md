# 2.5 Content Blog Editor

**Goal**: To review and polish the generated blog post fragments in the `sections/` directory, improving formatting, readability, and adding helpful glossary tooltips. This agent works with the modular fragment system where each section is a separate HTML file.

### Step 1: Review the Blog Structure and Fragments

- Read the main `index.html` file to understand the overall blog structure and topic.
- Review the `CHECKLIST.md` to see which sections have been completed.
- Read through all completed fragment files in the `sections/` directory to understand the full content scope.
- Prioritize editing fragments in this order:
  1. `sections/sources.html` (reference for citations)
  2. Main content sections (introduction, topic sections, conclusion)
  3. `sections/summary.html`
  4. `sections/glossary.html`
  5. `sections/prefix-panel.html`

### Step 2: Format and Polish Each Fragment

For each fragment file in the `sections/` directory:

- **Text Formatting**: Apply formatting to enhance readability and visual hierarchy:
    - Use `<strong>` or `<b>` tags to bold key terms, important phrases, or sentences that require emphasis.
    - Use `<em>` or `<i>` tags for italics on words that need a different kind of emphasis, are foreign, or are being introduced.
    - Ensure blockquotes (`<blockquote>`) are used for direct quotes from sources.
    - Check that headings are structured logically (`<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.) and consistently.

- **Consistency Check**: Ensure each fragment follows the structure patterns from `section_examples/` directory.

### Step 3: Identify and Add Glossary Terms

While editing content fragments, identify technical, specialized, or non-colloquial terms that a general audience might not be familiar with.

For each identified term, you must do two things:

1. **Add an inline tooltip in the content fragment**: Wrap the term in the main text with a `<span>` element to create a hover-over tooltip:

    ```html
    <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="Your concise definition here.">The Term</span>
    ```

2. **Add an entry to the `sections/glossary.html` file**: Add a corresponding definition using this HTML template:

    ```html
    <div class="bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-800 p-3 rounded-lg border border-slate-200 dark:border-slate-700">
        <h4 class="font-semibold text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-200">The Term</h4>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400">Your concise definition here.</p>
    </div>
    ```

### Step 4: Validate Fragment Structure

For each edited fragment, ensure:
- [ ] Fragment contains ONLY inner content (no `<html>`, `<head>`, or `<body>` tags)
- [ ] All CSS classes match the patterns from `section_examples/`
- [ ] Dark mode compatible styles are maintained
- [ ] Source citations use the proper format: `<a href="#source1" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[1]</a>`
- [ ] All glossary terms are properly marked with tooltips
- [ ] Content follows the established HTML structure patterns

### Step 5: Cross-Reference and Quality Check

- **Glossary Consistency**: Ensure all glossary terms marked in content fragments have corresponding entries in `sections/glossary.html`.
- **Source Citations**: Verify all citations in content fragments reference sources listed in `sections/sources.html`.
- **Flow Check**: Read through fragments in order to ensure they flow logically and maintain consistent terminology.

### Step 6: Final Polish (Optional Improvements)

DO NOT EDIT THE INTENT AND MEANING OF THE ORIGINAL CONTENT

Additional improvements you can make:
- **Consistency**: Ensure consistent terminology, tone, and style across all fragments.
- **Clarity**: Identify and improve unclear sentences while maintaining the original meaning.
- **Transitions**: Suggest adding transition sentences at the beginning or end of fragments if needed for better flow.

### Step 7: Update Checklist

After completing edits to each fragment:
- Mark the fragment as "âœ“ Edited and Polished" in the `CHECKLIST.md`
- Ensure all glossary terms are documented
- Verify all formatting follows the modular structure guidelines
