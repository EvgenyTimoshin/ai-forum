        If you've interacted with an AI recently, it was likely through a chatbot interface. You give it a prompt, it gives you a response. This single-turn interaction is powerful, but it's just the tip of the iceberg. A more profound shift in AI is happening, moving from simple instruction-following to autonomous, multi-step problem-solving. This is the world of <strong>agentic workflows</strong>.

        An agentic workflow is a system where an <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="An autonomous software program, often powered by an LLM, designed to perform specific tasks, make decisions, and interact with its environment.">AI agent</span> (or a team of agents) can take a complex goal, break it down into a series of tasks, execute those tasks, and reflect on its own work to improve the outcomeâ€”all with minimal human intervention. This is a move from AI as a simple tool to AI as a capable, autonomous partner.

            <strong>Key Insight:</strong> The excitement around agentic AI is growing rapidly. According to a LangChain survey, while 51% of companies use agents in production now, a staggering 78% have active plans to implement them soon<a href="#source2" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[2]</a>.

        This very blog post was created using such a workflow. An AI agent followed a predefined, modular process to research, outline, write, and assemble this content. In this article, we'll dissect how this workflow functions, explore the core concepts powering modern agentic systems, and look at where this transformative technology is headed.
