# SOURCES FOR REMOTE VIEWING BLOG POST

## Source 1: [Remote viewing (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_viewing)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive encyclopedia overview providing balanced coverage of remote viewing claims and scientific criticism
**Key Points**:
- Remote viewing defined as "practice of seeking impressions about a distant or unseen subject, purportedly sensing with the mind"
- No scientific evidence exists and topic is generally regarded as pseudoscience
- Stargate Project: $20 million U.S. government program (1975-1995) ended after evaluators concluded remote viewers failed to produce actionable intelligence
- Scientific community rejection based on absence of evidence base, lack of explanatory theory, and lack of reliable experimental techniques
- Key criticism: experiments historically lacked proper controls and repeatability
- Sensory cues problem: David Marks and Richard Kammann found clues in transcripts that explained positive results

## Source 2: [CIA-Initiated Remote Viewing At Stanford Research Institute](https://www.newdualism.org/papers/H.Puthoff/CIA-Initiated%20Remote%20Viewing%20At%20Stanford%20Research%20Institute.htm)
**Purpose**: First-hand account from Harold Puthoff, founder and first director of the CIA's remote viewing program
**Key Points**:
- Program began in 1972 when CIA representatives visited SRI after seeing Puthoff's preliminary work with Ingo Swann
- Initial experiments involved Swann allegedly perturbing a magnetometer and drawing its internal structure
- Early "coordinate remote viewing" experiments using geographic coordinates
- Semipalatinsk experiment: Pat Price's remote viewing of Soviet nuclear test site described as having "several details concerning the salient technology"
- Program expanded from 1975 onward into multi-agency, multi-million dollar effort
- Eventually involved 22 active military and civilian remote viewers at peak
- Official statements from President Carter and CIA officials acknowledging use of psychics

## Source 3: [Ingo Swann (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingo_Swann)
**Purpose**: Biographical information about key remote viewing pioneer and his claims
**Key Points**:
- Ingo Swann (1933-2013): American psychic, artist, and author credited with creating the term "Remote Viewing"
- Former Scientologist who reached high Operating Thetan levels, which purportedly extended psychic abilities
- Conducted magnetometer experiments at Stanford Research Institute that allegedly showed psychokinetic effects
- Jupiter remote viewing session in 1973 claimed to detect rings around Jupiter before their official discovery
- Brain activity studies by Michael Persinger in 2001 showed "significant congruence" between stimuli and Swann's EEG activity
- Worked on criminal cases 1972-1979: claimed 22 failures, 3 successes out of 25 cases

## Source 4: [Stargate Project (U.S. Army unit) (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Project_(U.S._Army_unit))
**Purpose**: Detailed information about the U.S. government's operational remote viewing program
**Key Points**:
- Secret U.S. Army unit established 1977 at Fort Meade, Maryland by Defense Intelligence Agency
- Small-scale operation: 15-20 individuals in "old, leaky wooden barracks"
- Overseen by Lt. Frederick Holmes "Skip" Atwater until 1987
- Program terminated and declassified in 1995 after CIA report concluded it was "never useful in any intelligence operation"
- Information provided was "vague and included irrelevant and erroneous data"
- Background: CIA and DIA reacted to reports of Soviet parapsychology research spending 60 million roubles annually
- Various code names: Gondola Wish, Grill Flame, Center Lane, Sun Streak, Scanate

## Source 5: [Remote viewing (Skeptic's Dictionary)](https://www.skepdic.com/remotevw.html)
**Purpose**: Critical skeptical analysis of remote viewing claims and experimental methodology
**Key Points**:
- Remote viewing described as "fancy name for telepathy or clairvoyance"
- Isaac Asimov analysis of Jupiter/Mercury remote viewing claims: 46% of observations were wrong, only 1 out of 65 claims was non-obvious fact
- CIA evaluation problems: experiments conducted in secret, making peer review impossible; single judge (Edwin May) evaluated all results; no independent replication
- Methodological flaws: ambiguous success criteria allowing confirmation bias, no precise definition of "hit" before tests begin
- Jessica Utts vs. Ray Hyman evaluation disagreement: Utts (believer) claimed evidence for psychic functioning, Hyman (skeptic) noted fatal experimental design flaws
- Example experiment analysis showing subjective validation in judging "hits"

## Source 6: [A PERCEPTUAL CHANNEL FOR INFORMATION TRANSFER OVER KILOMETER DISTANCES (CIA Document)](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/cia-rdp96-00787r000500020001-6)
**Purpose**: Original 1976 Stanford Research Institute scientific paper on remote viewing experiments funded by CIA
**Key Points**:
- 117-page technical report by Harold Puthoff and Russell Targ detailing early remote viewing experiments
- Historical perspective on psychic research dating back to William Crookes and D.D. Home in 1860s
- Experimental methodology using geographical coordinates and "beacon" persons at target sites
- Claims that distance (up to 4000 km) and Faraday cage electrical shielding did not degrade perception quality
- Statistical analysis of experiments with multiple subjects
- Detailed experimental protocols and transcripts included
- Published in Proceedings of the IEEE March 1976
