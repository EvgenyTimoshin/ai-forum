## Source 1: [Hacking Consciousness: Mindfulness Meditation, Ego Death, and Enlightenment Engineering](https://greymattersjournal.org/hacking-consciousness-mindfulness-meditation-ego-death-and-enlightenment-engineering/)
**Purpose**: This source provides a scientific and neurological perspective on mindfulness meditation, its roots in Buddhist traditions, and the concept of ego death. It's valuable for explaining the tangible effects of these practices on the brain.
**Key Points**:
- Mindfulness meditation (MM) aims to quiet mental chatter and the ego, altering consciousness.
- Long-term MM can lead to a state of "oneness" or "global non-selective, non-judgmental awareness."
- fMRI studies show MM refines brain networks, improving emotional regulation, attentional control, and self-awareness.
- It can decrease activity in the amygdala (fear-regulation) and increase it in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) for better cognitive control over emotions.
- Ego dissolution, or "ego death," is described in three stages: quieting the first-person narrative, loss of body ownership (depersonalization), and loss of spatial self-location, leading to a feeling of integration with the world.
- The article touches on "technodelics" and "enlightenment engineering," which aim to replicate meditative states with technology.

## Source 2: [No Self In Buddhism & Science: Tame The Ego, Start Living](https://mindfulstoic.net/no-self-in-buddhism-and-science/)
**Purpose**: This article explores the Buddhist concept of "no self" (anatta) and connects it to scientific, particularly neuropsychological, findings. It provides a philosophical and practical framework for understanding and taming the ego.
**Key Points**:
- The sense of self (ego) is considered an illusion in Buddhism, and attachment to it is a source of suffering.
- The concept of "no self" doesn't mean you don't exist, but that the ego isn't a static, commanding entity.
- Neuroscientist Sam Harris is quoted, suggesting that looking for the "I" behind thoughts reveals no author; thoughts simply arise.
- The book "No Self, No Problem" by Chris Niebauer is referenced, linking the sense of self to left-brain processes (language, pattern recognition) which are interpretations, not reality itself.
- The article discusses the "Five Poisons of Ego Delusion" from Buddhism as a practical framework for practicing "no self": greed, aggression, pride, jealousy, and envy.
- It offers practical advice on how to counteract these "poisons" to lessen ego-attachment.
