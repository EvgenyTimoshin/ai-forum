        In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, the concept of "agentic" systems is moving from a niche interest to a central pillar of application development. But what exactly is an <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="A system where an LLM is empowered to decide its own control flow to solve complex problems, often by using tools and breaking tasks into steps.">agentic workflow</span>? At its core, it represents a shift from a single-prompt, single-response interaction with a Large Language Model (LLM) to a more dynamic, multi-step process managed by one or more specialized AI agents <a href="#source4" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[4]</a>.

    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Instead of a static, predetermined control flow, an agentic system gives the LLM the power to decide the best course of action. It can choose which tools to use, what steps to take, and in what order. This allows for a much more flexible and powerful approach to problem-solving, enabling AI to tackle complexity that would be intractable with a simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline.

            <strong>Key Insight:</strong> The transition to agentic workflows is driven by the need to solve more complex problems. Industry data shows that the average number of steps in an LLM application trace has more than doubled in the last year, from 2.8 to 7.7 steps, signaling a clear move toward multi-step, agent-driven processes <a href="#source2" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[2]</a>.

       This blog post will explore this exciting frontier. We will first dissect the very workflow that was used to generate this article, providing a concrete example of a modular, multi-agent system in action. We'll then zoom out to look at the broader trends in the industry and present five concrete, new applications where these workflows could be revolutionary.
