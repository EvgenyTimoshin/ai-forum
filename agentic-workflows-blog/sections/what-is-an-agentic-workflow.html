<div class="section-content">
    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        At its core, an agentic workflow is a process designed to mimic human problem-solving. Instead of relying on a single, monolithic command, it uses AI agents that can perform a sequence of actions, use tools, and even collaborate with other agents to achieve a goal. According to AI expert Andrew Ng, four key design patterns have emerged as foundational to these workflows<a href="#source5" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[5]</a>.

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-200">The Four Pillars of Agentic Design</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 ml-4 mb-4">
        <li>
            <strong>Reflection:</strong> Agents review their own work to find flaws and improve it. For instance, an agent might write a block of code, test it, find a bug, and then rewrite the code to fix the bug without being prompted.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Tool Use:</strong> Agents can use external tools to overcome their inherent limitations. This could be as simple as using a web search to find up-to-date information or as complex as running code in a sandboxed environment to test a hypothesis.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Planning:</strong> For complex tasks, agents first create a step-by-step plan. This <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="The process of breaking down a large task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.">task decomposition</span> allows the agent to tackle large problems methodically, addressing each part of the plan in sequence.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Multi-Agent Collaboration:</strong> Multiple agents can work together as a team. One agent might be a "Researcher," another a "Coder," and a third a "Critic." This division of labor allows for more robust and sophisticated outcomes, as each agent brings a specialized skill to the problem<a href="#source4" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[4]</a>.

    </ul>

            <strong>The Power of Process:</strong> The magic of <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="Automated, multi-step processes carried out by AI agents to achieve complex goals.">agentic workflows</span> isn't just in the intelligence of a single <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="An artificial intelligence model trained on vast amounts of text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like text, code, and other content.">AI model</span>, but in the structure of the process itself. A well-designed workflow can enable a less powerful model like GPT-3.5 to outperform a more powerful one like GPT-4 on complex tasks like coding<a href="#source5" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[5]</a>.
