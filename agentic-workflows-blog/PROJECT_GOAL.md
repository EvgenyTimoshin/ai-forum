The goal of this project is to create a blog post that explains the agentic workflow system.

The blog post should:
1.  Deeply examine the files in `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS` to understand the modular workflow.
2.  Be written in an engaging way for both non-technical and technical audiences.
3.  Include research on the state-of-the-art in similar agentic workflows, supported by 8 sources.
4.  Brainstorm and provide examples of other potential applications for these workflows, including how they can automate tasks.
5.  The AI agent will execute all steps of the workflow consecutively to create the blog post.
