# Agent Task: 1. Create Content Plan

**Objective:** To create a comprehensive content plan and update the main workflow checklist with a detailed, structured set of writing tasks.

## Your Workflow:

1.  **Understand the Goal:**
    -   Read `PROJECT_GOAL.md` to fully grasp the objectives of the blog post.

2.  **Create a Plan:**
    -   Create a new file named `PLAN.md` in the project directory.
    -   Based on the project goal, create a detailed outline for the blog post within `PLAN.md`. This plan is the blueprint for the entire content creation process.
    -   The structure should include:
        -   A compelling title.
        -   `Introduction`: Hook the reader and state the post's purpose.
        -   `Section 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... -N`: Break down the main topics into logical sections. For each section, list the key points, arguments, or data to be included. Add alot of detail here! This is a comprehensive directors plan for an amazing detailed blog.
        -   `Conclusion`: Summarize the key takeaways and provide a closing thought.
        -   `Glossary`: Define key terms that will be used in the post.
        -   `Sources`: This section will be populated during the writing process when agents conduct just-in-time research.

3.  **Update the Workflow Checklist:**
    -   Read `PLAN.md` to get the full list of content section titles.
    -   Count the total number of sections and divide them into four quarters, rounding up.
    -   Read the `HIGH_LEVEL_WORKFLOW_CHECKLIST.md` file.
    -   For each of the four quarters, add the topics for every piece of the structure to be written.
    -   Under each main task, create indented sub-task items for each section title belonging to that quarter (e.g., `    - [ ] 3. Write Section: Introduction`).
    -   Find the line containing `- [ ] 2. HTML SETUP` in the checklist and insert these new structured tasks immediately after it.

4.  **Final Step:**
    -   Mark the `1. Create Content Plan` task as complete (`[x]`) in `HIGH_LEVEL_WORKFLOW_CHECKLIST.md`.
    -   Your task is now finished. The next agent will proceed with HTML setup.
