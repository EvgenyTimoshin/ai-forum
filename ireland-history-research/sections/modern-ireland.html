        The Anglo-Irish Treaty split the republican movement, leading to the <strong>bitter Irish Civil War</strong> (1922-1923) between the pro-Treaty forces, who supported the new Irish Free State, and the anti-Treaty IRA, who wanted a full republic. The pro-Treaty side was victorious, but the conflict left a lasting legacy on Irish politics <a href="#source1" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[1]</a>.

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-200">The Republic of Ireland</h3>
    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        The Irish Free State gradually distanced itself from Britain. In 1937, a new constitution was adopted, and the state was renamed Ireland (or Ã‰ire). It remained neutral during World War II. In 1949, Ireland formally declared itself a republic and left the British Commonwealth <a href="#source2" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[2]</a>.

        The latter half of the 20th century saw significant economic and social change. After decades of economic stagnation and high emigration, Ireland experienced a period of <strong>rapid economic growth</strong> from the 1990s onwards, which became known as the <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="A period of rapid economic growth in the Republic of Ireland from the mid-1990s to the late 2000s.">Celtic Tiger</span>. Socially, the country became more liberal, with the influence of the Catholic Church declining <a href="#source2" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[2]</a>.

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-200">Northern Ireland and The Troubles</h3>
    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        In Northern Ireland, the 20th century was marked by <strong>sectarian conflict</strong>. The Catholic minority faced discrimination in housing, jobs, and political power from the ruling Protestant Unionist majority. This led to a civil rights movement in the late 1960s, which was met with a violent response <a href="#source1" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[1]</a>.

    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        This period, known as <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="The ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland during the late 20th century.">The Troubles</span>, lasted for three decades and involved paramilitary groups like the IRA and loyalist forces, as well as the British Army. The conflict resulted in over 3,000 deaths. A peace process eventually led to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, which established a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland <a href="#source1" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[1]</a>.

            <strong>A Hard-Won Peace:</strong> The Good Friday Agreement was a landmark achievement in the peace process, creating a framework for a devolved, power-sharing government and largely bringing an end to decades of violence in Northern Ireland.
