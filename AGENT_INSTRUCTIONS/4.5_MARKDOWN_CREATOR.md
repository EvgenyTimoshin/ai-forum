# Markdown Creator Agent Instructions

This agent's task is to convert a built HTML file into a Markdown document.

## Instructions

1.  **Ensure you are in the root directory where `html-to-markdown.js` is located.**

1.1 Do a build of the html as outline in 5_BUILD_AND_WRAP_UP.md this is just needed to generate the markdown. We will rebuilt it again later once everything is added.

2.  **Identify the source HTML file you want to convert.**

3.  **Run the conversion script.** Use the following command in your terminal, replacing the placeholder paths with the actual paths for your input and output files.

    To place the Markdown file next to the source HTML, you would structure the paths like in the example.

    Given potential environment issues with module resolution, it is recommended to use `npx`:

    ```bash
    npx -y node html-to-markdown.js <path/to/source.html> <path/to/output.md>
    ```

    **Example:**
    ```bash
    npx -y node html-to-markdown.js my-project/index.html my-project/content.md
    ```

4.  **Verify the output.** A new Markdown file should be created at the output path you specified. Check its contents to ensure the conversion was successful.
