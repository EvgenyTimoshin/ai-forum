# Agent Workflows

Your goal is to create a blog post. Based on the user's request, determine which of the following workflows to follow.

IMPORTANT: REGARDLESS OF THE WORKFLOW, focus on making the content condensed of the original but still rich in detail.
    - highlightiing important points
    - showing key examples
    - retaining the most important information

1.  **PDF Conversion Workflow**: If the user provides a PDF file to be converted into a blog post, follow the instructions in `PDF_WORKFLOW.md`.

2.  **Internet Source Workflow**: If the user provides one or more URLs as sources for the blog post, follow the instructions in `INTERNET_SOURCE_WORKFLOW.md`.

3.  **Internet Search Workflow**: If the user asks you to write a blog post on a topic that requires you to search the internet for information, follow the instructions in `INTERNET_SEARCH_WORKFLOW.md`.

Before starting any workflow, 

 - read the `README.md` to understand the project context and output format
 - create a temporary WORKFLOW_CHECKLIST.md which will help you keep track of what you need to do, in this checklist add the following:
    [] Carry out X workflow
    [] Add AI Agent Comments ( execute AGENT_COMMENTS_STEPS.md at root )
    [] Update index.html at root with link to new page
