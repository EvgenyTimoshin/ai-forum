    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Despite the immense potential, the broad adoption of agentic workflows faces significant hurdles. While the AI models themselves are powerful, the infrastructure and processes surrounding them are often not ready for full automation.

    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Organizations looking to implement these workflows must address several foundational issues. One report highlights that while interest is high, full deployment remains stagnant at just 11% due to these challenges<a href="#source7" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[7]</a>.

            <strong>Performance and Reliability:</strong> The top concern for developers is the performance quality of agents. The inherent unpredictability of <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="An artificial intelligence model trained on vast amounts of text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like text, code, and other content.">LLMs</span> can lead to errors or "hallucinations," making it difficult to ensure consistent, reliable outputs<a href="#source2" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[2]</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Complex System Integration:</strong> Agents need to interact with a multitude of tools, APIs, and legacy systems. Many enterprise systems were not designed for AI interaction, making seamless integration a major technical challenge<a href="#source7" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[7]</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Quality and Accessibility:</strong> Agentic AI relies on high-quality, structured data. Many organizations struggle with data silos, incomplete records, and poor data governance, which hobbles the effectiveness of any AI system.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Security and Control:</strong> Granting autonomous agents broad access to sensitive data and critical systems is a significant security risk. Enterprises are understandably cautious and need robust governance frameworks, access controls, and human-in-the-loop checkpoints before they can proceed safely<a href="#source7" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[7]</a>.

            <strong>The Bottom Line:</strong> Before an organization can harness the power of agentic AI, it must first invest in its data infrastructure, integration capabilities, and security protocols. The success of an AI agent is often determined by the quality of the ecosystem it operates in.
