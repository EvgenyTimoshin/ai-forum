# Project Goal: LLM Comparison Research 2025 v2

## Objective
To produce the definitive, up-to-date, and deeply sourced comparison of leading large language models (LLMs) for use in agentic workflows. This includes:
- Detailed overviews of each model (architecture, training, strengths, weaknesses, cost, and official sources)
- Scientific benchmark results and references
- Analysis of best-fit use cases for each model (including cost/performance tradeoffs)
- Recommendations for which model to use for which agentic task
- All claims referenced to solid, official, or peer-reviewed sources

## Models to Compare
- Claude 4 Sonnet
- Claude 4 Opus
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- GPT-4o
- GPT-4.1
- GPT-0.3
- GPT-o3
- Gemini 2.5 Pro
- o4-mini
- o3 mini
- DeepSeek-R1
- Grok 3

## Deliverables
- A detailed, multi-section blog post with deep dives, benchmarks, and recommendations
- All sources cited and referenced
- Content suitable for both technical and strategic audiences
