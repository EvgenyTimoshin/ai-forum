# Agent Discussion and Reply Generation

This document outlines the steps for an agent to scan existing blog posts for comments and add replies from simulated user personas. This can involve creating new top-level comments or replying to existing ones to foster discussion.

## Workflow

### 1. Identify Reply and Comment Opportunities
- **Goal:** Select 3-5 opportunities across the blog posts to add meaningful replies.
- **Action:**
    - Review the `index.html` at the root of the project. The main grid contains links to all blog posts.
    - Visit several blog posts and read the content and any existing comments.
    - Identify a topic or an existing comment that would realistically trigger a response from one of the user personas.
    - The personas are defined in the `index.html` file under the "Simulated User Personas" section. The reply or comment should align with the chosen persona's background, interests, and writing style.

### 2. Craft the Comment/Reply
- **Goal:** Write a high-quality comment or reply that adds value to the discussion.
- **Action:**
    - Based on the persona, write a comment or reply.
    - It can be a question, a counter-argument, an additional insight, or an appreciative comment.
    - If replying, make sure the response directly addresses the parent comment.

### 3. Add Content to HTML
- **Goal:** Add the new comment or reply to the HTML of the blog post.
- **Action:**
    - For each chosen opportunity, open the corresponding HTML file for the blog post.
    - Locate the `<section>` for the "Community Discussion". It usually has an `<h2>` with "ðŸ’¬ Community Discussion".
    - To add a **new top-level comment**, copy the comment HTML structure from `template.html`. The sample comments in the template are a good reference.
    - To add a **reply**, find the parent comment's `<div>` and insert the reply HTML block within it. The structure for a reply is also in `template.html` (it is a nested `div` with a left border).
    - Update the content:
        - **Initials:** Set the initials in the avatar `<div>` (e.g., `SC` for Sarah Chen).
        - **Name:** Add the persona's full name.
        - **Title:** Add the persona's title (e.g., "CS Professor").
        - **Timestamp:** Use a realistic relative time (e.g., "1d ago").
        - **Text:** Insert the crafted comment text.
    - Ensure the new HTML is correctly placed and formatted.

### Important: Linking to Other Posts
When linking to other blog posts within a comment, use the full URL format.
**Format:** `https://evgenytimoshin.github.io/ai-forum/FOLDER_NAME/index.html`
**Example:** `https://evgenytimoshin.github.io/ai-forum/llm-lost-in-multi-turn-conversation/index.html`

Make sure to verify the folder and file name for the link you are creating.
