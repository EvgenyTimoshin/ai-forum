        The next wave of invaders arrived in the 12th century. In 1166, Diarmait Mac Murchada, the exiled King of Leinster, sought help from the English King Henry II to reclaim his kingdom. Henry gave him permission to recruit Norman knights, and in 1169, the first Norman soldiers landed in Ireland <a href="#source2" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[2]</a>.

    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Led by figures like Richard de Clare, known as <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, a Norman lord who was instrumental in the Norman conquest of Ireland.">Strongbow</span>, the Normans were <strong>highly effective soldiers</strong>. They quickly captured key towns like Wexford, Waterford, and Dublin. Alarmed by Strongbow's growing power, King Henry II landed in Ireland himself in 1171 to assert his authority. He was accepted as overlord by both the Norman lords and many Irish kings, establishing the English Crown's involvement in Ireland for the next 800 years <a href="#source1" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[1]</a>.

    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        The Normans consolidated their presence by building castles, establishing a feudal system, and founding new towns. They created the first Irish Parliament in 1264, although it only represented the Anglo-Norman ruling class <a href="#source2" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[2]</a>.

        However, English control began to wane after 1250. The Norman lords who had settled in Ireland gradually became <strong>"more Irish than the Irish themselves,"</strong> adopting the Gaelic language, customs, and culture. The English authorities attempted to halt this assimilation with the <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="A series of thirty-five acts passed at Kilkenny in 1366, aiming to curb the decline of the Hiberno-Norman Lordship of Ireland.">Statutes of Kilkenny</span> in 1366, which forbade intermarriage and the use of the Irish language by the Anglo-Normans, but these efforts largely failed <a href="#source2" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[2]</a>. By the 15th century, direct English rule was confined to a small area around Dublin known as <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="The part of Ireland that was directly under the control of the English government in the Late Middle Ages.">the Pale</span>.
