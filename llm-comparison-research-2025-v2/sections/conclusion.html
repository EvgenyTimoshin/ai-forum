        The LLM landscape in 2025 is more diverse, capable, and competitive than ever before. No single model dominates every benchmark or use case. Instead, the optimal agentic system is a network of specialized models, each selected for its strengths at a given workflow step<a href="#source10" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[10]</a>.

        Our modular, source-cited, and benchmark-driven approach reveals that:

        <li>Claude 4 Opus and Gemini 2.5 Pro lead on the most demanding, long-context, and agentic tasks</li>
        <li>Sonnet 4, o3-mini, and DeepSeek-R1 offer near-flagship performance for cost-sensitive or open-source needs</li>
        <li>Grok 3 and GPT-4o are top choices for real-time, up-to-date, and multimodal workflows</li>
        <li>Benchmarks like SWE-bench, GPQA, AIME, and MMLU are essential for transparent, evidence-based model selection</li>

            <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The future of agentic AI is modular, multi-model, and evidence-driven. Practitioners should continuously evaluate new models, update their agent networks, and ground decisions in transparent benchmarks and real-world use cases.
