## 2. Content Generation

**Goal**: To write the blog post content in `index.html` using the research gathered in `SOURCES.md`.

### Step 1: Create Content Checklist

- Based on your `SOURCES.md`, identify the main sections for the blog post.
- Create a `CHECKLIST.md` file with specific content sections. 

    ```markdown
    [] Introduction
    [] [Main Topic Section 1]
    [] [Main Topic Section 2]
    ... N sections
    [] Conclusion
    [] Sources Section
    [] Glossary Section
    ```

### Step 2: Update the Source Section in HTML

- Before writing the main content, update the "Sources" section at the bottom of the `index.html` file. This allows you to reference sources as you write.

### Step 3: Write Content Section by Section

- Go through your `CHECKLIST.md` and write the content for each section one by one!
- For each section:
    - **Reference `SOURCES.md`** for facts, examples, and quotes.
    - Write condensed, clear, and detailed content.
    - Add the content to `index.html`.
    - **Cite your sources** in the content using this HTML format:
        ```html
        <a href="#source1" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[1]</a>
        ```
    - Mark the section as done in `CHECKLIST.md` after you have written it.

### Step 4: Finalize

- Review the complete `index.html` for coherence, formatting, and accuracy.
- Ensure all sections from `CHECKLIST.md` are completed and included in the final blog post.
