        Our workflow is just one example of a broader trend. Across the industry, developers are moving towards more complex, agent-driven systems. However, this adoption is happening cautiously. A 2024 survey by LangChain found that while over half of professionals are using agents in production, performance quality and reliability remain the biggest barriers to wider implementation <a href="#source2" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[2]</a>.

    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Researchers have begun to formalize the different types of agentic workflows. A recent survey on the topic identifies three main categories that are becoming standard patterns <a href="#source3" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[3]</a>:

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 ml-4 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Policy-Only Workflows:</strong> The simplest form, where an agent directly decides on an action. The popular <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="A framework that stands for Reason and Act, where an agent verbalizes its reasoning process before choosing a tool or action.">ReAct</span> framework is a prime example.</li>
        <li><strong>Search Workflows:</strong> More advanced systems where agents explore multiple possible paths or "trains of thought." An evaluator agent then assesses the different paths to select the most promising one.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback-Learning Workflows:</strong> These agents can iteratively improve their work. They feature a "self-critique" or "reflection" step, where an agent evaluates its own output and then refines it. Our own workflow simulates this by having separate agents for creation and editing.</li>
    </ul>

            <strong>Key Insight:</strong> The most common use cases for agents today are for research and summarization, as well as personal productivity <a href="#source2" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[2]</a>. This shows a strong focus on automating time-consuming knowledge work, which is exactly what the workflow for this blog post is designed to do.

        Ultimately, while the excitement is high, the industry is still in the early stages of figuring out best practices. The most successful implementations are highly structured, often keeping a <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="A process where key decisions or actions made by an AI agent must be approved by a human before execution.">human-in-the-loop</span> for critical decisions to ensure safety and reliability.
