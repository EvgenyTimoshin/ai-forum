<div class="section-content">
    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        The first evidence of humans in Ireland dates back to the Mesolithic period, around 8000 BC <a href="#source2" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[2]</a>. These early inhabitants were hunter-gatherers who lived along the coastlines and rivers, subsisting on fish, birds, and wild animals like deer and boar.

    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Around 4000 BC, farming was introduced to Ireland, marking the beginning of the Neolithic period. These early farmers cleared forests, cultivated crops, and raised livestock such as sheep, pigs, and cattle <a href="#source2" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[2]</a>. They also left behind <strong>remarkable stone monuments</strong>, including:

        <li><strong>Dolmens:</strong> Simple tombs made of large upright stones supporting a massive capstone.</li>
        <li><strong>Court Cairns:</strong> More complex tombs with a central courtyard.</li>
        <li><strong>Passage Tombs:</strong> Impressive structures with a central passage leading to a burial chamber, all covered by a large mound of earth. The most famous example is <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="A prehistoric monument in County Meath, Ireland, built during the Neolithic period, around 3200 BC.">Newgrange</span>, which is aligned to capture the light of the winter solstice sunrise <a href="#source1" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[1]</a>.</li>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-200">The Bronze and Iron Ages</h3>
    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Around 2000 BC, the use of bronze was introduced, leading to the creation of more sophisticated tools, weapons, and ornaments. This period also saw the construction of numerous stone circles and defensive lake dwellings known as crannogs <a href="#source2" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[2]</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        The Iron Age began in Ireland around 500 BC with the arrival of the <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="A group of people who spread across Europe, and whose culture and language had a major influence on early Ireland.">Celts</span>. They brought with them iron technology, which gave them a <strong>military advantage</strong>. Celtic Ireland was not a unified kingdom but a collection of small, often warring kingdoms. Their society was hierarchical, with kings and aristocrats at the top, followed by freemen (farmers), and slaves at the bottom <a href="#source2" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[2]</a>. The Celtic priests, known as <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="A high-ranking professional class in ancient Celtic cultures.">Druids</span>, held significant power and religious authority.

            <strong>Legacy:</strong> The monuments of ancient Ireland, like Newgrange, are a powerful reminder of a sophisticated prehistoric culture, while the arrival of the Celts laid the linguistic and cultural foundations for the Ireland of today.
