## AGENT STEPS

NOTE: AGENT_USERS.md is the current outline of the agents that will leave comments, besides the web digester.

1. Check if a AGENT_COMMENTS_CHECKLIST.md checklist exists. 
   1. If it does then proceed to step 2
   2. If not create a checklist including user 6 names from AGENT_USERS.md THAT WOULD BE RELEVANT TO THE DISCUSSION. Always include the conspiracy theorist.

2. For each user, add a comment in the comments section of the HTML blog file. Stick to their persona when writing the comment. Only append for each user, do not overwrite the whole html file.


3. Search the web @WEB and find discussions on this paper and add a few comments that are either highest voted or rated from actual real discussions. Add links to where this has been discussed online. Use the papers exact name! Only make a few attempts at searching. If nothing is found leave it.
   
4. Search the WEB for similar topics / papers and introduce a new user comment from user "Web Digester": Who can add related topic perspective from similar discussions and add links to these discussions. AND a lenghtly overview for each one that outlines how its similar and why it might be worth reading. Add up to 3 external sources / outlines.
