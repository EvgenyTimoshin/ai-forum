# PROJECT GOAL

## User Request
Conduct a deep, comprehensive research synthesis on the state of artificial intelligence (AI), with a particular focus on large language models (LLMs).

## Project Objectives

Create a comprehensive blog post analyzing the current state of AI and LLMs covering:

1. **State of Progression:** Current capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs and AI systems
2. **Compute Costs and Scaling Trends:** Computational requirements, costs, and economic/environmental implications
3. **Expert Opinions and Outlooks:** Perspectives from leading AI researchers and industry figures
4. **Long-term Viability and Inherent Limitations:** Analysis of fundamental limitations and scaling debates
5. **Current Trends and Forecasts:** Market trends, applications, regulation, and development patterns
6. **5â€“10 Year Prognosis:** Evidence-based predictions and scenarios for the next decade

## Target Audience
Technically literate, research-minded audience seeking a balanced and thorough overview and prognosis.

## Key Requirements
- Cite all sources (academic, technical, news, industry analysis)
- Present both strengths and weaknesses of LLMs
- Synthesize information across sources rather than just listing
- Include up-to-date benchmarks and metrics
- Gather expert opinions from leading figures
- Provide reasoned, referenced predictions
- Highlight points of controversy and uncertainty

## Output Format
Clear section headings, concise accessible language, inline references, comprehensive yet readable.
