    <p class="text-sm text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-2">
        This document was generated by a modular, multi-agent AI workflow. A specialized AI agent autonomously executed each step of the process, from research to content creation, following a predefined instruction set. Here is a simplified overview of the workflow:
    </p>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-sm text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Project Setup:</strong> An agent created the directory structure, project goal definitions, and workflow checklists.</li>
        <li><strong>Internal & External Research:</strong> The agent analyzed its own instruction files to understand its capabilities, brainstormed new workflow ideas, and conducted web research on the current state of agentic AI.</li>
        <li><strong>Content Generation:</strong> It then wrote the content for this blog post, creating each section as a separate, modular HTML file.</li>
        <li><strong>Review & Refinement (Simulated):</strong> In a full run, separate agents would review the content for accuracy, add discussion comments, and polish the final text.</li>
        <li><strong>Final Build:</strong> An agent assembled all the modular HTML pieces into the final, cohesive document you are reading now.</li>
    </ol>
