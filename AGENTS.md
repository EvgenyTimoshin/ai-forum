IMPORTANT: Create a new directory to work out of!

IMPORTANT: CARRY OUT ALL OF THE STEPS TILL THE VERY END ALL CHECKLISTS MUST BE COMPLETED

IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE TO ALAWYS UPDATE AND CHECK THE CHECKLIST AT EVERY STAGE.

IMPORTANT: REGARDLESS OF THE WORKFLOW, focus on making the content condensed of the original but still rich in detail and content.
    - reflects the original content extensively
    - keeps all of the most important and interesting informations
    - highlightiing important points
    - showing key examples!


STEPS:

1.  **Setup Files**:
- Create a new directory for the blog post inside the root of the project. The directory name should be based on the topic.
- Inside the new directory, create a copy of `template.html` from the root, renaming it to `index.html`.
- Update `index.html` to fix references to CSS and JS files (which are in the root).

2. Select the appropriate workflow:
A.  **PDF Conversion Workflow**: If the user provides a PDF file to be converted into a blog post, follow the instructions in `PDF_WORKFLOW.md`.

B.  **Internet Source Workflow**: If the user provides one or more URLs as sources for the blog post, follow the instructions in `INTERNET_SOURCE_WORKFLOW.md`.

C.  **Internet Search Workflow**: If the user asks you to write a blog post on a topic that requires you to search the internet for information, follow the instructions in `INTERNET_SEARCH_WORKFLOW.md`.
