# Agent Task: 1. Create Content Plan

**Objective:** To create a comprehensive content plan and update the main workflow checklist with dynamic writing tasks.

## Your Workflow:

1.  **Understand the Goal:**
    -   Read `PROJECT_GOAL.md` to fully grasp the objectives of the blog post.

2.  **Create a Plan:**
    -   Create a new file named `PLAN.md` in the project directory.
    -   Based on the project goal, create a detailed outline for the blog post within `PLAN.md`. This plan is the blueprint for the entire content creation process.
    -   The structure should include:
        -   A compelling title.
        -   `Introduction`: Hook the reader and state the post's purpose.
        -   `Section 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... -N`: Break down the main topics into logical sections. For each section, list the key points, arguments, or data to be included. Add alot of detail here! This is a comprehensive directors plan for an amazing detailed blog.
        -   `Conclusion`: Summarize the key takeaways and provide a closing thought.
        -   `Glossary`: Define key terms that will be used in the post.
        -   `Sources`: This section will be populated in later steps.

3.  **Prepare the Build File:**
    -   Read the project's `index.html` file.
    -   For each content section you defined in `PLAN.md` (except Glossary and Sources), create a `div` element that will load the section's content.
    -   Generate the `data-src` path from the section title (e.g., "The History of Agentic Workflows" becomes `sections/the-history-of-agentic-workflows.html`).
    -   Insert these `div` elements into the `<main id="content-container">` of the `index.html`.
    -   Example:
        ```html
        <main id="content-container">
            <div data-src="sections/introduction.html"></div>
            <div data-src="sections/section-the-history-of-agentic-workflows.html"></div>
            <div data-src="sections/section-core-components-of-an-agent.html"></div>
            <div data-src="sections/conclusion.html"></div>
            <div data-src="sections/glossary.html"></div>
            <div data-src="sections/sources.html"></div>
        </main>
        ```

4.  **Update the Workflow Checklist:**
    -   Read the `HIGH_LEVEL_WORKFLOW_CHECKLIST.md`.
    -   For **each** content section you defined in `PLAN.md` (e.g., Introduction, Section 1, Conclusion), add a new item to the checklist under the `4. Write Section` step.
    -   For example:
        ```markdowm
        - [ ] 4. Write Section: Introduction
        - [ ] 4. Write Section: The History of Agentic Workflows
        - [ ] 4. Write Section: Core Components of an Agent
        - [ ] 4. Write Section: Conclusion
        ```

5.  **Final Step:**
    -   Mark the `1. Create Content Plan` task as complete (`[x]`) in `HIGH_LEVEL_WORKFLOW_CHECKLIST.md`.
    -   Your task is now finished. The next agent will proceed with preliminary research.
