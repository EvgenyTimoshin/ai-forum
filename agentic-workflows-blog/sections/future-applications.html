    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        The potential for agentic workflows extends far beyond the current primary use cases. As the technology matures, we can envision more complex, multi-agent systems tackling a wide range of sophisticated tasks. The key is to think of agents as a digital workforce that can be assembled into teams to solve specific problems.

    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Imagine a team of AI agents tasked with accelerating scientific discovery. This team could be composed of several specialized agents working in concert<a href="#source4" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[4]</a>:

        <li>
            <strong>Literature Review Agent:</strong> This agent constantly scans new papers on arXiv, PubMed, and other sources, summarizing key findings and identifying gaps in current research.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Hypothesis Generation Agent:</strong> Based on the literature review, this agent proposes new, testable hypotheses.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Experiment Design Agent:</strong> This agent designs a detailed experimental protocol to test a given hypothesis, outlining the necessary steps, materials, and data collection methods.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Analysis Agent:</strong> After an experiment is run (by humans or robotic labs), this agent analyzes the resulting data, performs statistical tests, and visualizes the results.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Report Writing Agent:</strong> This agent takes the findings from the analysis agent and drafts a scientific paper, complete with an introduction, methods, results, and conclusion.
        </li>
    </ul>
