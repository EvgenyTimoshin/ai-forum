- The reviewer praises the variety already present in the early access version and is excited about the game's future potential.
- It is described as a "tiny scale" version of a *Total War* experience, which is an interesting comparison.

## Source 9: [‘9 Kings’ Is a Game I Need Y’all To Play - Vice](https://www.vice.com/en/article/9-kings-is-a-game-i-need-yall-to-play-its-a-roguelike-kingdom-management-deck-builder-and-i-must-break-it-demo-impressions/)
**Purpose**: This review provides another perspective on "9 Kings," with a strong emphasis on the player's personal experience of discovery and the joy of finding powerful, "broken" combinations.
**Key Points**:
- The author describes the game as one that "wants you to break it," encouraging experimentation and exploitation of hidden mechanics.
- It highlights the "revolving door" of other Kings challenging the player, which forces adaptation and opens up the deckbuilding possibilities exponentially.
- The review gives a narrative example of a run, including a failure caused by getting "too much, too soon" and mismanaging resources (specifically, gold for Mercenaries). This is a great example of a learning experience within a roguelike.
- It emphasizes the satisfaction of watching your troops "obliterate" enemy forces as a result of careful planning (or "pure, dumb luck").
- The author calls the game "strategic and chaotic in equal measure," which is a good summary of the roguelike experience.

## Source 10: [Gaming in a Skinner Box: Roguelikes and Psychology - SUPERJUMP](https://medium.com/super-jump/gaming-in-a-skinner-box-roguelikes-slot-machines-and-behavioral-psychology-730922e5a43c)
**Purpose**: This article directly tackles the psychology behind the addictiveness of roguelike games, which is a core part of the research project. It provides a clear explanation of the connection between roguelike mechanics and principles of behavioral psychology.
**Key Points**:
- The article draws a direct comparison between roguelikes and B.F. Skinner's operant conditioning chamber (the "Skinner box").
- It explains that the procedural generation and permadeath in roguelikes create a "variable ratio schedule of reinforcement," the same principle that makes slot machines addictive.
- The "high-response low-extinction" nature of this reinforcement schedule explains why players are motivated to keep playing even after many failures ("one more run").
- The article argues that the "jackpot" in a roguelike is the "right combination of items, pickups, enemies, and layouts that lead to a win."
- It makes a crucial distinction: while the underlying psychological principles are similar to gambling, the goal of a roguelike is to "extract the most amount of fun out of players," not money.
- It concludes with a warning to be aware of the psychology at play to maintain a healthy relationship with these games.

## Source 11: [Alexithymia in gaming addiction and engagement - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38479516/)
**Purpose**: This academic article provides a scientific perspective on the difference between gaming addiction and high but non-problematic gaming engagement. This is highly relevant to the research goal of understanding the psychology of gaming and addiction patterns.
**Key Points**:
- The study suggests that "alexithymia" (difficulty identifying and describing one's own emotions) is a strong predictor of gaming *addiction*, but not necessarily gaming *engagement*.
- It highlights the need to distinguish between problematic and non-problematic excessive gaming, as they have different associations with affect dysregulation.
- The findings suggest that people who are addicted to games may be using them to cope with or avoid difficult emotions they can't process, whereas highly engaged players may not have this issue.
- This provides a more nuanced view than the simple "games are addictive" narrative, suggesting that the player's psychological state is a key factor.
- The study's conclusion that addiction and engagement are "qualitatively different phenomena" is a crucial insight for the project's analysis.

## Source 12: [Deconstructing roguelikes: what makes them addicting? - Gamedev.net](https://www.gamedev.net/forums/topic/651895-deconstructing-roguelikes-what-makes-them-addicting/)
**Purpose**: This forum discussion offers a variety of perspectives from game developers and players on what makes roguelike games addictive. It provides anecdotal evidence and developer insights.
**Key Points**:
- A key point raised is the comparison to gambling, specifically noting two factors: high stake (permadeath) and quick turnaround (fast gameplay loops).
- One user mentions that "even death provides some progress" in many modern roguelites (meta-progression), which is a key motivator.
- The concept of "novelty" is brought up - seeing new things on each playthrough keeps the experience fresh.
- A user likens playing a roguelike to "untying a complex knot," where each run is a new puzzle to be solved, which is a great metaphor for the problem-solving appeal.
- The discussion highlights that for many players, the addiction comes from the combination of procedural content and loot, even in the absence of high-end graphics or sound.

## Source 13: [Hades 2 Early Access Review - IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/hades-2-early-access-review)
**Purpose**: This review of Hades II provides an in-depth look at a highly anticipated sequel to a majorly successful roguelike. It details the new mechanics, the new protagonist, and how the game builds upon the original's success, which is very relevant for the project's scope of analyzing popular and interesting roguelikes.
**Key Points**:
- Introduces the new protagonist, Melinoe, and her unique combat style, which includes a revamped magic system and a sprint-focused movement that changes the gameplay dynamic compared to the first game.
- Highlights the new "Omega" attacks, which use mana to create more powerful and strategic moves, adding another layer of resource management and build variety.
- Praises the depth of build-crafting options, noting that there are many viable builds and that runs rarely feel "doomed" due to bad luck with upgrades.
- Describes the expanded world, with two distinct paths to explore (the Underworld and the surface), each with unique enemies, bosses, and level design, significantly increasing content variety.
- Explains the new progression systems, such as the Arcana cards and the resource-gathering/crafting incantations, which provide long-term goals and a sense of constant progress between runs.
- The reviewer notes that even in early access, the game feels polished and substantial, with a compelling story and well-developed characters that live up to the high standard set by the original.

## Source 14: [Slay the Spire Review - IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/01/25/slay-the-spire-review)
**Purpose**: This review analyzes Slay the Spire, a foundational game in the modern deckbuilder roguelike subgenre. Its influence and mechanics are core to the project's research scope on popular and interesting roguelikes.
**Key Points**:
- Describes the core gameplay loop: starting with a basic deck, fighting monsters to add new cards, and adapting your strategy based on the randomized cards and powerful "Relics" you acquire.
- Highlights the three distinct characters (Ironclad, Silent, Defect), each with multiple viable playstyles and unique card pools, which creates immense replayability.
- Emphasizes the strategic depth of combat, where players can see enemy intents (attack, defend, buff) and must make tactical decisions to balance offense and defense.
- Praises the game's design for encouraging experimentation and learning from failure. Failed runs contribute to player knowledge rather than character power, making each new attempt a fresh challenge of skill and strategy.
- Mentions the high level of challenge and the various modes that add difficulty and variety, such as the daily climbs and escalating "Ascension" levels.
- Notes the game's significant influence on the genre, inspiring many other titles, and its strong modding community which adds even more content.

## Source 15: [Darkest Dungeon Review - IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/darkest-dungeon-review)
**Purpose**: This review covers Darkest Dungeon, a game known for its unique psychological stress mechanics and punishing difficulty, making it a key title for analysis within the scope of game psychology and addictive patterns research.
**Key Points**:
- The game's standout feature is the "Stress" system, where heroes' mental states are as important as their physical health. High stress can lead to afflictions like paranoia or masochism, causing characters to act unpredictably and adding a layer of psychological management.
- Combat is turn-based and heavily dependent on positioning. Characters have different skills available depending on their spot in the four-person lineup, and abilities that shuffle enemy or friendly ranks are highly strategic.
- The art style is described as "grim but expressive" and "hand-drawn," contributing to a powerful gothic, Lovecraftian atmosphere, complemented by strong narration.
- The game is intentionally difficult and features permadeath. The review highlights that knowing when to retreat from a failing mission is a crucial skill, creating constant tension.
- It involves deep party and resource management, from upgrading hero skills and equipment to treating diseases and managing stress back in the hamlet, making preparation as important as the dungeon crawl itself.
- While the game can be a long grind, its inherent randomness and the constant threat of disaster keep it from becoming repetitive.

## Source 16: [Risk Of Rain 2 Review - GameSpot](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/risk-of-rain-2-review/1900-6417527/)
**Purpose**: This review covers Risk of Rain 2, a 3D action roguelike that shifts the formula of its 2D predecessor into a new dimension. Its gameplay loop and escalating difficulty are highly relevant to the research.
**Key Points**:
- The core mechanic is a constantly increasing difficulty timer. The longer a run takes, the harder the game becomes, forcing a balance between exploring for items and progressing quickly.
- Unlike many roguelikes, item pickups are almost entirely additive. Players accumulate a wide variety of stackable perks, leading to wildly overpowered and synergistic builds by the late game.
- The game transitions the 2D side-scrolling action of the original into a 3D third-person shooter, creating a chaotic and fast-paced combat experience.
- Features a diverse roster of "Survivors" (classes), each with unique abilities and movement styles that encourage different strategies and item builds.
- The constant pressure and escalating chaos can be exhilarating but also exhausting, as there are few moments of rest between frantic battles.
- The review notes that while the core shooting can feel simple, the variety of enemies and the impact of the item builds are what make combat engaging.

## Source 17: [Vampire Survivors 1.0 Review - IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-survivors-1-review)
**Purpose**: This review examines Vampire Survivors, a minimalist "bullet heaven" roguelike that became a viral hit. Its simple controls and addicting progression system are key areas of interest for the research project.
**Key Points**:
- The game uses an extremely simple control scheme where the player only moves their character; all attacks are fired automatically. The core gameplay is focused entirely on positioning and dodging.
- The primary goal is to survive for 30 minutes against increasingly overwhelming waves of enemies.
- Progression comes from leveling up and selecting new weapons and passive abilities from a randomized pool. Creating powerful synergies between these items is crucial for survival.
- A key part of the addictive loop is "evolving" weapons by pairing a max-level weapon with a specific passive item, transforming it into a much more powerful version.
- The game's visual style is simple and pixelated, but the screen quickly fills with enemies and weapon effects, creating a chaotic and visually stimulating experience.
- Despite its simplicity, the game has a great deal of unlockable content, including characters, weapons, and secrets, which provides a strong incentive for repeated playthroughs.

## Source 18: [Caves Of Qud review: an obscenely rich roguelike realm you could get lost in for months - Rock Paper Shotgun](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/caves-of-qud-review)
**Purpose**: This review explores Caves of Qud, a traditional roguelike renowned for its deep world simulation and procedural generation. It represents a more complex and "classic" style of roguelike, which is a key area for the research project.
**Key Points**:
- The game is set in a "science-fantasy" world with a unique blend of ancient ruins, high technology, and bizarre mutant creatures.
- Character creation is incredibly deep, allowing players to build a wide variety of "mutants" with unique physical and mental mutations (e.g., extra limbs, pyrokinesis, time manipulation) or "True Kin" who use cybernetics.
- The world is a mix of fixed locations and procedurally generated history, lore, and dungeons, creating a new experience with every playthrough.
- It features a complex faction and reputation system where the player's actions can make them friends or enemies with nearly every type of creature in the world, from goatfolk to sentient plants.
- The game is known for its emergent storytelling, where the complex simulation of physical and political systems leads to unique and often bizarre anecdotes and character histories.
- While it has a traditional, often challenging, roguelike structure with permadeath, it also offers more forgiving modes for players who want to focus on exploration and story.

## Source 19: [Spelunky 2 Review - IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/spelunky-2-review)
**Purpose**: This review provides an analysis of Spelunky 2, a sequel to one of the most influential modern roguelikes. It's important for the research to understand how this series has evolved and continues to shape the genre.
**Key Points**:
- Spelunky 2 builds upon the original's formula of a 2D platformer with procedurally generated levels, devious traps, and a high degree of emergent gameplay where game systems interact in unpredictable ways.
- The sequel introduces branching paths, allowing players to choose their route through the game, with each path offering unique environments, enemies, and secrets.
- New mechanics like rideable mounts and liquid physics (e.g., lava flows when its container is destroyed) add more layers of complexity and potential for both hilarious success and failure.
- The game is described as brutally difficult, but fair. Death is a learning experience, and player skill and knowledge are more important than in-game progression.
- It retains the core loop of short, intense runs where the goal is to get as far as possible, learn from mistakes, and try again, making it highly rewarding and replayable.
- The review emphasizes the feeling of discovery, with a vast number of secrets, hidden levels, and mysterious items to uncover, many of which are still being found by the community.

## Source 20: [Dead Cells Review - IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/08/11/dead-cells-review)
**Purpose**: This review looks at Dead Cells, a highly successful "rogue-vania" that blends the structure of a Metroidvania with roguelike mechanics. Its fast-paced combat and progression systems are important to analyze for the research project.
**Key Points**:
- Dead Cells combines fast-paced, fluid 2D action-platforming combat with the permadeath and procedural generation of a roguelike.
- The game features a "risk and reward" design, encouraging players to move quickly through levels to access timed doors with extra rewards, but at the cost of being less thorough.
- Progression is persistent between runs. Players collect "Cells" from defeated enemies, which are used to unlock new weapons, skills, and permanent upgrades that appear in subsequent attempts.
- There is a wide variety of weapons, traps, and skills that allow for diverse and synergistic builds, encouraging experimentation and adaptation based on what items are found during a run.
- The game has a "Metroidvania" structure, with permanent, unlockable abilities (runes) that open up new paths and secret areas in the procedurally generated levels on future runs.
- The review praises the game's satisfying and responsive movement and combat, which makes the core loop of dying and restarting enjoyable rather than frustrating.
