        This report presents the most up-to-date, in-depth comparison of leading <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="Large Language Models: advanced AI systems trained on massive datasets to understand and generate human language.">LLMs</span> for agentic workflows, including Claude 4 Opus & Sonnet, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek-R1, Grok 3, and more. We analyze each model's architecture, training, strengths, weaknesses, cost, and best-fit use cases, referencing official documentation and scientific benchmarks.

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        The analysis draws on a rigorous, modular research process: every claim is source-cited, and all major benchmarks (SWE-bench, GPQA, AIME, MMLU, LiveCodeBench) are compared side by side. We provide actionable recommendations for model selection in agentic systems, highlighting where cost-effective models excel and where only the most advanced models will suffice.
