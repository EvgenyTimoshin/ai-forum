        The late 19th and early 20th centuries were dominated by the campaign for <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="Movement to secure internal autonomy for Ireland within the British Empire.">Home Rule</span>, or self-government for Ireland. The Irish Parliamentary Party, led by Charles Stewart Parnell, made significant gains, but Home Rule bills were <strong>repeatedly defeated or postponed</strong> <a href="#source1" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[1]</a>.

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-200">The Easter Rising</h3>
    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        Frustration with the political process led a small group of Irish republicans to stage the <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="An armed insurrection in Ireland during Easter Week, April 1916.">Easter Rising</span> in Dublin in 1916. The rebellion was quickly crushed, and initially, it had little public support. However, the British decision to execute 15 of its leaders provoked widespread public outrage and a <strong>massive swing in public opinion</strong> in favor of the rebels and the cause of independence <a href="#source2" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[2]</a>.

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-200">The War of Independence and Partition</h3>
    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        In the 1918 general election, the republican party <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="An Irish republican and democratic socialist political party active throughout both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.">Sinn Féin</span> won a <strong>landslide victory</strong>. Their elected members refused to sit in the British Parliament, instead forming their own Irish parliament, the Dáil Éireann, and declaring independence <a href="#source1" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[1]</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        This led to the Irish War of Independence (1919-1921), a guerrilla war between the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and British forces, including the controversial <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="A force of temporary constables recruited to assist the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) during the Irish War of Independence.">Black and Tans</span>. The war ended with the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921. The treaty created the Irish Free State, consisting of 26 of Ireland's 32 counties, as a self-governing dominion within the British Empire. The remaining six counties in the north, which had a Protestant majority, remained part of the United Kingdom, creating Northern Ireland. This partition of the island would become a central issue for the next century <a href="#source1" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[1]</a>.

            <strong>From Failure to Success:</strong> The Easter Rising was a military failure but a political masterpiece, transforming public opinion and paving the way for the War of Independence and the eventual creation of the Irish state.
