    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        The psychological foundation of roguelike addiction mirrors that of gambling through <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="Unpredictable reward schedules that create strong behavioral patterns">variable ratio reinforcement schedules</span>, but with a crucial difference: the goal is extracting fun and engagement rather than money<a href="#source10" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[10]</a>. This distinction allows players to develop healthy, skill-focused relationships with these games while still experiencing the compelling "one more run" phenomenon.
