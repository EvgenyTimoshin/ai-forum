        What makes these games so compelling? The answer lies in a potent combination of psychological triggers, game design patterns, and reward systems that tap into fundamental aspects of human behavior. Unlike traditional games with fixed narratives and predictable challenges, roguelikes offer <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="Game content generated algorithmically to create unique experiences">procedural generation</span> and <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="Complete loss of progress upon death, requiring players to restart">permadeath</span> mechanics that create a unique psychological experience<a href="#source10" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[10]</a>.

    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        The traditional definition of roguelikes, codified in the <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="A formal definition of traditional roguelike features, emphasizing turn-based combat, ASCII graphics, and complex systems">"Berlin Interpretation,"</span> emphasizes features like ASCII graphics, turn-based combat, and complex systems<a href="#source2" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[2]</a>. However, modern players and developers have expanded this definition to include games that capture the <em>feeling</em> of a roguelike rather than strictly adhering to technical requirements. This evolution has led to the rise of <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="Games that incorporate roguelike elements with other genres or more forgiving mechanics">roguelites</span> and hybrid genres that broaden the appeal while maintaining psychological core.
