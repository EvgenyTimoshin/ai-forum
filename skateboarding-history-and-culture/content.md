## 2\. The 1950s-1960s: The Birth of Skateboarding

The story of skateboarding begins in the 1950s, when **Californian surfers**, looking for a way to "surf" the streets when the waves were flat, began attaching roller skate wheels to wooden planks. This new activity, dubbed "**sidewalk surfing**," quickly gained popularity, and by the early 1960s, the first commercially produced skateboards were being sold \[1\].

These early skateboards were **primitive by today's standards**, with steel or clay wheels that offered little grip or maneuverability. However, they laid the foundation for the sport, and by the mid-1960s, the first skateboarding competitions were being held. The invention of the **polyurethane wheel** in the early 1970s would revolutionize the sport \[2\].

## 3\. The 1970s: The Zephyr Team and the Dogtown Revolution

The 1970s marked a turning point for skateboarding, largely due to two key developments: the invention of the **polyurethane wheel** and the emergence of the **Zephyr Competition Team**, also known as the **Z-Boys**, from the Dogtown area of Santa Monica, California \[1\].

The polyurethane wheel, introduced in the early 1970s, was a **game-changer**. It provided a smoother, faster ride with significantly more grip, allowing for a more aggressive and fluid style of skateboarding. This technological leap, combined with the Z-Boys' raw, surf-inspired approach, revolutionized the sport. They took skateboarding from a simple pastime to a dynamic art form, pioneering a new style of vertical and aerial maneuvers in the empty swimming pools of Southern California.

## 4\. The 1980s: The Rise of Vert Skating and Street Style

The 1980s saw skateboarding's popularity explode, driven by the rise of **vert skating** and the emergence of street style. Vert skating, which involved performing aerial maneuvers on large ramps, became the dominant form of professional skateboarding, with stars like **Tony Hawk** and **Christian Hosoi** pushing the boundaries of what was possible \[9\].

At the same time, a new style of skateboarding was developing in the streets. Led by pioneers like **Rodney Mullen** and **Mark Gonzales**, **street skating** focused on performing technical tricks on and over urban obstacles. Mullen, in particular, is credited with inventing many of the foundational tricks of modern street skating, including the flatground **ollie**, which allows skaters to leap into the air without using their hands \[9\].

The decade also saw the release of **"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater"** in 1999, a video game that became a cultural phenomenon and introduced a new generation to skateboarding. The game's success, combined with the X Games' popularity, helped to solidify skateboarding's place in the mainstream and paved the way for its continued growth in the 21st century \[7\].
