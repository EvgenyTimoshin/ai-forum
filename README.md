# AI Document Digester

A single-file, self-contained HTML "digest" that transforms any long-form content into clean, readable web pages with interactive features and quality-of-life improvements.

## What We Built

A streamlined HTML application that converts lengthy documents‚Äîresearch papers, articles, reports, opinion pieces, white papers, or any substantial text‚Äîinto a clean, readable web interface with enhanced user experience features.

## How It's Made: AI Agent Workflows

This repository uses AI agents to automate content creation through several workflows:

*   **PDF Conversion**: Converts academic papers, reports, or other documents from PDF into the structured HTML digest format.
*   **Web Source Distillation**: Creates a digest from a list of provided web articles or sources, synthesizing the information into a cohesive document.
*   **Topic Research & Synthesis**: Generates a digest on a given topic by searching the web for relevant information and synthesizing it into a new document.

## Content Layer

| Part | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Prefix panel** | Explains how the document was condensed ‚Äì what was retained, condensed, or omitted and the source/s of the document.|
| **Summary section** | A succinct overview of the document's main points and key arguments |
| **Organized sections** | Walk the reader through the document's structure with clear headings and logical flow |
| **Glossary** | Defines recurring acronyms, technical terms, or specialized vocabulary |

## UX / UI Features

| Feature | How it works | Why it helps |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| **Sticky mini-TOC** | Auto-built from every `<h2>`; hidden off-screen with a ‚ò∞ tab that slides in on hover. Re-generates whenever you collapse/expand to stay accurate | Quick navigation and section overview |
| **Collapsible sections** | Clicking any `<h2>` folds the section away; state toggles CSS + recalculates TOC and progress. Lets skimmers hide detail they don't need | Customizable reading experience |
| **Reading-progress bar** | 4px accent strip at top (scrollY / (scrollHeight ‚Äì viewport)); updates after every resize or collapse. Quick visual cue of "how much is left" | Visual progress tracking |
| **Dark-mode toggle** | Round button (üåô / ‚òÄÔ∏è) top-right; swaps data-theme attribute. Uses CSS variables so colours flip instantly and preference sticks in localStorage | Eye comfort and user preference |
| **Glossary tooltips** | Under-dotted terms get hover pop-overs (pure CSS) with one-line definitions‚Äîkeeps main text uncluttered | Contextual help without interruption |
| **Responsive design** | Max-width 70ch for comfortable reading; TOC hides on screens < 900px; everything works offline (no external libs) | Universal accessibility |
| **AI-Generated Discussion** | Simulates a comment section with personas defined in `AGENT_USERS.md`. The agent also performs a web search to incorporate real-world discussions and related topics via a 'Web Digester' persona. | Enriches the content with diverse perspectives, provides additional context, and surfaces related topics for deeper understanding. |
| **Highlight callouts & styled elements** | Colored boxes for key points, quotes, warnings; clean table styling for data presentation | Enhanced content hierarchy |

## Tech Stack

- **HTML + Tailwind CSS** ‚Äî styling via Play CDN
- **Vanilla JS** (< 90 lines) to build the TOC, handle collapses, theme switching, and progress-bar updates

**Tailwind CSS Reference:** [Play CDN Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn)


## GitHub Pages

The repository can be hosted using **GitHub Pages** directly from the `main` branch. The `index.html` file provides links to each digested paper and the `.nojekyll` file ensures the site is served without Jekyll processing.
