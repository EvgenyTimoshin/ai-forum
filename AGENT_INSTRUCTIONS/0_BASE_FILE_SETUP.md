# 0. Base Files Setup

1.  Create a new directory for the blog post (e.g., `new-blog-post-topic/`).
2.  Copy `template.html` from root to `index.html` inside the new directory!!!
3.  Fix paths in `index.html` to correctly reference the root CSS/JS files.
4.  Add a new entry for the project to `blogs.md` and set its status to `In Progress`.
5.  Set this new project as the **Active Project** in `blogs.md`. 
6.  Create a `PROJECT_GOAL.md` file in the new directory. And update it with the user's request and high-level goals for the blog post.
