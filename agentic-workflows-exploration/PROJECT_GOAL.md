# Project Goal: Create a Blog Post on Agentic Workflows

This project aims to create a comprehensive blog post that explores the agentic workflow system we have developed.

## Main Goals:

1.  **Explain Our Current Workflow:**
    -   Conduct a deep analysis of the files in `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS`.
    -   Clearly explain the modular, step-by-step nature of the workflow.
    -   Highlight the benefits of this design: reliability, repeatability, and scalability for parallel agent execution.
    -   Present the information in an engaging and detailed manner.

2.  **Propose Future Applications:**
    -   Brainstorm and outline at least five potential new applications for similar agentic workflows.
    -   Focus on tasks that are repeatable and can be automated.
    -   Provide concrete examples of how agent capabilities (tool use, code generation, web search) can automate time-consuming computer-based tasks.

3.  **Research the State-of-the-Art:**
    -   Conduct web research on the current landscape of LLM agentic workflows.
    -   Investigate key topics such as context management, scaling agent execution, task splitting, and routing.
    -   The findings from all goals will be used to generate the blog post content. The initial research will be documented in `SOURCES.md`.
