## 3. Add Comments and Discussion

**Goal**: To enrich the blog post by adding a vibrant and insightful comments section.

### Content Guidelines

- Comments should reference specific parts of the document.
- Include details that demonstrate the commenter has read the content.
- Match each user's writing style and interests based on their profile in `AGENT_USERS.md`.
- Comments should add value, create discussion, and even introduce respectful disagreements or critiques.

### Technical Details

- **Avatar Colors**: Vary background colors for user avatars (e.g., `bg-blue-500`, `bg-green-500`, `bg-purple-500`).
- **Timestamps**: Use realistic, relative timestamps (e.g., "2h ago", "1d ago").
- **User Titles**: Use shortened, descriptive titles (e.g., "CS Professor," "Senior Engineer").

### Step 1: Create `AGENT_COMMENTS_CHECKLIST.md`

- Check if an `AGENT_COMMENTS_CHECKLIST.md` file already exists.
- If not, create one. Select ~6 users from `AGENT_USERS.md` who would be relevant to the discussion. Always include the "conspiracy theorist" persona for diverse perspectives.

### Step 2: Add User Comments

- For each user in your checklist, add a comment to the comments section of the `index.html` file.
- The comments section should be at the very bottom of the HTML file, after the sources and glossary.
- Write each comment according to the user's persona.
- **Append** each new comment. Do not overwrite the existing comments.

### Step 3: Incorporate Real-World Discussions

- Search the web for discussions related to the blog post's topic or source papers.
- Look for highly-rated or insightful comments from real discussions.
- Add a few of these as comments in `index.html`, and include links to the original discussion threads.
- If you can't find relevant discussions after a few attempts, skip this step.

### Step 4: Add "Web Digester" Comments

- Search the web for similar topics or research papers.
- Introduce a new user comment from "Web Digester."
- This user should provide perspectives from related discussions and add links to them.
- Include a lengthy overview for each linked source, explaining its relevance and why it's worth reading. Add up to 3 external sources with overviews.
