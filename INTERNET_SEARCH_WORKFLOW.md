## Internet Search Workflow

1.  **Identify Topic**: Understand the core topic the user wants a blog post about.

2.  **Setup Files**:
    - Create a new directory for the blog post inside the root of the project. The directory name should be based on the topic.
    - Inside the new directory, create a copy of `template.html` from the root, renaming it to `index.html`.
    - Update `index.html` to fix references to CSS and JS files (which are in the root).

3.  **Search for Information**:
    - Identify good search keywords from the user's request.
    - Use the web search tool to find relevant articles and sources.
    - From the search results, select 3-5 high-quality sources.
    - Mark off in the relevant checklist that you have already searched!

4.  **Outline Content**:
    - Read through the selected sources.
    - Identify the main sections and key points to cover in the blog post.
    - Create an outline and add the main sections as checklist items in `CHECKLIST.md`.
    - Make sure sources section is included in the checklist
    - Also add a small overview of each source and what its purpose is in the checklist so that we can use these to reference as we write the sections.

5.  **Write Content**:
    - Go through the checklist. For each item:
        - Synthesize the information from your sources for that section.
        - Write a condensed and clear version for the blog post.
        - Add the content to the `index.html`.
        - Mark the item as done in `CHECKLIST.md`.
        - IMPORTANT: Add subtle links to references from the original source where vital information / stats / examples are shared!!!

6.  **Finalize**: Once all sections are complete, review the `index.html` file for coherence and formatting. Add a "Sources" section at the end, listing the URLs you used.
