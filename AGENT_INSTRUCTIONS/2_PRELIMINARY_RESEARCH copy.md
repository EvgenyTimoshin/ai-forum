# Agent Task: 2. Preliminary Research

**Objective:** To conduct initial research for the blog post based on the content plan and gather a foundational set of sources.

## Your Workflow:

1.  **Understand the Plan:**
    -   Read `PLAN.md` to understand the full scope and structure of the planned blog post. Pay close attention to the topics and key points for each section.

2.  **Conduct Research:**
    -   For each major section and key point outlined in `PLAN.md`, perform targeted web searches to find relevant information.
    -   Your goal is to gather a broad but relevant set of initial sources. Look for high-quality articles, research papers, documentation, and reputable websites.

3.  **Compile Sources:**
    -   As you find useful resources, add them to the `PLAN.md` file under the relevant area of the planned blog.
    -   Use a consistent format for each source, such as Markdown link format:
        ```markdown
        - [Title of the Article or Page](https_com)
            - Bullet pointed extracted information that we can use
            - info 
            - info
            - ..... extract ALOT! get qoutes, stats, examples, numbers etc
        ```
    -   Ensure that the sources you add are directly relevant to the topics in `PLAN.md`.

4.  **Final Step:**
    -   Once you have gathered a solid foundation of preliminary sources, mark the `2. Preliminary Research` task as complete (`[x]`) in `HIGH_LEVEL_WORKFLOW_CHECKLIST.md`.
    -   Your task is now finished. The next agent will map these sources to the content plan.
