## 1. Research and Source Analysis

**Goal**: To gather and analyze sources for the blog post, culminating in a detailed `SOURCES.md` file.

### Step 1: Identify Topic and Sources

- **If the user provides URLs**: Use these as the primary sources.
- **If the user provides a topic**: Conduct a web search to find 3-5 high-quality, relevant sources.

### Step 2: Create `WORKFLOW_CHECKLIST.md`

Create a `WORKFLOW_CHECKLIST.md` file in the project directory to track high-level progress:

```markdown
[] Process & analyze all sources
[] Create detailed SOURCES.md with source analysis
```

### Step 3: Process and Document Sources

- **For each source URL** (whether provided by the user or found via search):
    - Read the content of the page.
    - Announce your intention before starting research if you are searching: *"I will now conduct research by searching the web. When I'm finished, I will immediately update `SOURCES.md` with my findings."*

- **Create `SOURCES.md`**: This file will contain a detailed analysis of each source. Use the following format:

    ```markdown
    ## Source 1: [Title of Source](URL)
    **Purpose**: Explain why this source is valuable for the blog post.
    **Key Points**:
    - List important facts, statistics, or specific details.
    - Include interesting examples or case studies.
    - Add relevant quotes or insights. If possible, use URL text fragments to highlight specific text (e.g., `https://example.com#:~:text=highlighted%20text`).

    ## Source 2: [Title of Source](URL)
    ... (repeat for all sources)
    ```

### Step 4: Finalize

- Once all sources are processed and documented in `SOURCES.md`, mark the tasks as complete in `WORKFLOW_CHECKLIST.md`.
