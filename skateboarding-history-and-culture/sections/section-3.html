        The polyurethane wheel, introduced in the early 1970s, was a <strong>game-changer</strong>.

This technological leap, combined with the Z-Boys' raw, surf-inspired approach, revolutionized the sport. They took skateboarding from a simple pastime to a dynamic art form, pioneering a new style of vertical and aerial maneuvers in the empty swimming pools of Southern California.
