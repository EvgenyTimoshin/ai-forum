# LLM Comparison Research 2025 - Project Goals

## Project Overview
This project aims to conduct comprehensive research on the current state of Large Language Models (LLMs) with up-to-date information, providing a detailed comparison of leading models to help organizations make informed decisions about model selection for different tasks.

## Primary Objectives

### 1. Comprehensive Model Analysis
- Research and document detailed information about each of the following models:
  - Claude 4 Sonnet
  - Claude 4 Opus
  - Claude 3.5 Sonnet
  - GPT o3
  - Gemini 2.5 Pro
  - GPT 4.1
  - GPT 4o
  - o4-mini
  - DeepSeek-R1
  - o3 mini
  - Claude 3.7 Sonnet
  - Grok 3

### 2. Performance Benchmarking
- Gather and analyze benchmark data from reliable sources
- Compare models across various performance metrics
- Provide scientific evaluation of model differences
- Include references to official benchmarks and third-party comparisons

### 3. Use Case Optimization
- Identify what each model excels at
- Provide clear recommendations for:
  - Which cheaper models can handle specific tasks effectively
  - Where more expensive models are necessary
  - Risk assessment for different model choices
  - Cost-benefit analysis for various use cases

### 4. Practical Application Framework
- Analyze the agent workflow in this project (AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS)
- Recommend optimal model selection for each workflow step
- Consider factors like:
  - Task complexity
  - Required accuracy
  - Cost efficiency
  - Response time requirements
  - Risk of failure
