        The 16th century marked a new phase of English intervention in Ireland. King Henry VIII declared himself King of Ireland in 1541 and began a policy to bring the island fully under crown control. This led to the <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="The process by which the English crown gradually gained control over Ireland between 1536 and 1603.">Tudor conquest of Ireland</span>, a century-long process of negotiation and <strong>brutal warfare</strong> <a href="#source1" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[1]</a>.

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-200">The Plantations</h3>
    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        A key policy of this era was the <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="The confiscation of land by the English crown and the colonisation of this land with settlers from Great Britain.">Plantations</span>, where land was confiscated from Irish Catholic landowners and given to Protestant settlers from England and Scotland. The most significant of these was the Plantation of Ulster in the early 17th century, following the "Flight of the Earls" in 1607, when Gaelic chieftains fled to Europe. This policy <strong>dramatically altered the religious and cultural landscape</strong> of Ulster and sowed the seeds of future conflict <a href="#source2" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[2]</a>.

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-200">Wars and Penal Laws</h3>
    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        The 17th century was <strong>one of the bloodiest in Irish history</strong>. The Irish Rebellion of 1641 was followed by the brutal Cromwellian conquest (1649-53), which resulted in a massive loss of life and further land confiscations <a href="#source1" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[1]</a>. Later in the century, Ireland became the battleground for the Williamite War, culminating in the defeat of the Catholic King James II by the Protestant William of Orange at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.
