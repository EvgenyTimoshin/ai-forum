        The 4th and 5th centuries marked a <strong>profound transformation</strong> in Irish society with the arrival of Christianity. While some missionaries were likely active in the south of Ireland earlier, the traditional date for the arrival of <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="The patron saint of Ireland, credited with bringing Christianity to the island in the 5th century.">Saint Patrick</span> is 432 AD <a href="#source2" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[2]</a>. The new faith gradually replaced the old Celtic polytheism, and Ireland entered a "golden age" of monasticism.

        From the 6th to the 8th centuries, Irish monasteries became <strong>renowned centers of learning and art</strong> throughout Europe. Monks preserved classical knowledge and produced exquisite illuminated manuscripts, such as the famous <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="An illuminated manuscript Gospel book in Latin, containing the four Gospels of the New Testament together with various prefatory texts and tables.">Book of Kells</span>. Irish missionaries, like Saint Columba, traveled to Scotland and northern England, spreading Christianity and establishing new monasteries <a href="#source1" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[1]</a>.

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-200">The Viking Age</h3>
    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
        This golden age was violently disrupted by the arrival of the Vikings. The first recorded Viking raid occurred in 795 AD <a href="#source1" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[1]</a>. For the next two centuries, these Scandinavian raiders plundered monasteries and settlements along the coasts.

        However, the Vikings were not just raiders; they were also <strong>traders and town-builders</strong>. In the 9th century, they founded Ireland's first towns, including Dublin, Wexford, Cork, and Limerick, which became important centers of trade <a href="#source2" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[2]</a>. Over time, the Vikings settled in Ireland, intermarried with the Irish, and converted to Christianity, becoming the Norse-Gaels. The Viking threat to the rest of Ireland was largely ended in 1014 when the High King <span class="glossary-term relative border-b border-dotted border-slate-400 cursor-help" data-definition="A High King of Ireland who fought the Battle of Clontarf in 1014.">Brian Boru</span> defeated a combined Viking and Leinster army at the Battle of Clontarf, though Boru himself was killed in the battle <a href="#source1" class="no-audio text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">[1]</a>.
