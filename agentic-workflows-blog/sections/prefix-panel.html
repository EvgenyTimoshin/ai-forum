    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-sm text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Project Setup:</strong> The agent created the necessary directories and files, including checklists to track its own progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Research & Analysis:</strong> It analyzed its own workflow instructions and conducted web searches to gather 8 external high-quality sources on agentic AI.</li>
        <li><strong>Content Generation:</strong> The agent broke the blog post into logical sections and wrote the content for each section as a separate HTML file.</li>
        <li><strong>Content Editing:</strong> An automated editing pass will refine formatting, style, and clarity.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Simulation:</strong> The agent will generate a simulated discussion in a comments section to add context and engagement.</li>
        <li><strong>Final Build:</strong> The agent will combine all the HTML sections into a single, cohesive file, ready for publishing.</li>
